# ASCII-Converter-
Java project that reads in a photo with the .JPG extension, and return the image in both a new window and an exported .txt file- which holds the image to scale, via every pixel- to-char.


I initially developed this example using the Swing framework, to then later update the UI to java FX. However, the specific task of reading in a buffered image, reading the image pixel by pixel and converting it line by line to a texpPanel, was something I was unable to achieve within FX. I had similar results when utilizing FXML markups, however this was also my first time even exploring their concepts within java. 

The program allows one to select and import an image from the file menu, to which a JPanel pops up displaying the converted image in asci (While also printing a copy). It achieves this by using three methods, Convert, PositiveString, and Negative String. 
    Although this isnâ€™t how I originally intended to design this program, I learned quite a lot about JavaFX, FXML, and implementing buttons/UI elements.
